# Make.com JSON Response Fix

## Problem
Make.com is returning JSON with literal newlines in the `recommendations` string, which is invalid JSON. This causes the error:
> "Bad control character in string literal in JSON at position 65"

## Quick Fix (Already Implemented)
The app now handles this malformed JSON by:
1. Attempting to parse the response normally
2. If that fails, manually extracting the `recommendations` field
3. This is a workaround and will work, but it's better to fix it at the source

## Proper Fix in Make.com (Recommended)

To fix this properly in your Make.com scenario, you need to ensure the JSON response has properly escaped newlines.

### Option 1: Use the JSON Module
In your Make.com scenario's final "Webhook Response" module:

1. Set the response format to **JSON**
2. Use the JSON module to format your response:
   ```
   {
     "status": "success",
     "recommendations": "{{formatJSON(your_recommendations_variable)}}"
   }
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Escaping
If you're building the JSON manually, replace newlines before sending:

1. Add a "Text Operator" module before the webhook response
2. Use "Replace" to escape newlines:
   - **Text**: `{{your_recommendations_text}}`
   - **Pattern**: `\n` (newline)
   - **Replace with**: `\\n` (escaped newline)

3. In your webhook response, use the output from step 2

### Option 3: Use the HTTP Response Module
Instead of the basic Webhook Response:

1. Use "HTTP" â†’ "Make a Response"
2. Set Status: `200`
3. Set Headers:
   - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
4. Body: Use the JSON.stringify() function if available, or ensure proper escaping

## Testing
After making changes in Make.com:
1. Test your scenario
2. Check the response in Make.com's execution history
3. The recommendations field should show `\n` instead of literal line breaks
4. Example of valid JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "success",
     "recommendations": "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
   }
   ```

## Current Workaround
The app now handles the malformed JSON automatically, so users won't see the error. However, fixing it in Make.com is still recommended for:
- Better performance (no fallback parsing needed)
- More reliable data handling
- Cleaner error logs
