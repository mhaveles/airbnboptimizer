faq:
  - question: "How often should I review my Airbnb description?"
    answer: "At least once per season, or anytime guest behavior or feedback starts to shift."
  - question: "Is this checklist more important for large properties?"
    answer: "Yes. The more complex the layout or guest use case, the more clarity matters."
  - question: "What's the most important part of an Airbnb description to check?"
    answer: "The opening lines. If guests can't tell who the listing is for within the first few sentences, they're likely to keep scrolling."
  - question: "Can I use this checklist for multiple listings?"
    answer: "Yes. It works for any listing type, but becomes more important as properties get larger or more complex."
  - question: "Should I rewrite my description if it fails this checklist?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Sometimes small edits to structure or clarity are enough. Start with the gaps before doing a full rewrite."

Before you rewrite your Airbnb description, I'd start here.

This checklist isn't about clever wording.
It's about removing friction — the kind that causes hesitation, questions, or mismatched bookings.

You can run through this in ten minutes.

## 1. Guest clarity check
- Is it obvious who this listing is *best* for?
- Would a guest know within the first few lines if it fits their trip?

If the answer is "maybe," that's a signal.

## 2. Stay-purpose check
- Does the description explain *why* someone would choose this place over similar ones?
- Is the use case clear (group stay, quiet retreat, work-friendly, event-adjacent)?

Guests book faster when they don't have to infer intent.

## 3. Layout clarity check
Especially important for:
- Large homes
- Multi-level properties
- Group listings

Verify that:
- Bedroom locations are explained
- Shared vs private spaces are clear
- Flow through the home makes sense on first read

## 4. Expectation check
- Are there any "gotchas" guests should know upfront?
- Would a guest feel surprised by anything after arrival?

Surprises don't help conversion or reviews.

## 5. Photo-to-text alignment
- Does the description explain what photos *can't*?
- Are standout features named early, not assumed?

Photos attract clicks.
Descriptions close decisions.

## 6. Scanability check
- Short paragraphs
- Clear structure
- No walls of text

Most guests skim. Make skimming work in your favor.

## 7. Decision-ease check
Ask one simple question:
> Does this description make booking feel easier than the next listing?

If not, there's probably friction hiding somewhere.

### Shortcut if you want a second set of eyes
If you don't want to manually audit all of this, [AirbnbOptimizer](https://airbnboptimizer.com?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=description-checklist) can flag clarity gaps quickly — particularly helpful for complex listings where small misalignments add up.

Not a replacement for judgment.
Just a faster way to see what guests might be missing.

A good description doesn't convince.
It reassures.

When guests feel like they understand the space, bookings follow naturally.
