When guests can't book, they rarely explain why.

They just leave.

### Common blockers hosts miss

- Minimum stays that conflict with travel patterns
- Guest requirements stacked too tightly
- Calendar gaps that look available but aren't bookable

Each rule makes sense alone. Together, they stop bookings.

### How to spot it

Search your listing in incognito mode. Try to book a realistic stay.

If you hesitate, guests already have. These friction points are often invisible until you [audit as a guest would](/blog/increase-airbnb-bookings).
