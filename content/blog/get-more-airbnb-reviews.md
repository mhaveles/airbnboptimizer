Reviews don't reward effort.

They reward alignment.

### Why reviews stall

Most low-review listings hosted guests who were:

- Unsure what to expect
- Slightly mismatched to the space
- Pleasant, but not delighted

That shows up as silence or four stars.

### How reviews actually increase

- The listing filters for the right guest
- The stay matches the photos exactly
- Nothing feels surprising or unclear

When guests feel understood before arrival, reviews follow naturally. This connects to [what actually increases bookings](/blog/increase-airbnb-bookings).

If you're unsure where expectations break down, tools like [AirbnbOptimizer](https://airbnboptimizer.com?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=get-more-reviews) can help surface clarity gaps.
