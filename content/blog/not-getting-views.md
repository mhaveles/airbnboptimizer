Views disappear before bookings do.

That's usually the warning sign.

### Why impressions decline

Airbnb tests listings constantly. If guests skip yours, it learns quickly.

Common causes:

- Cover photo doesn't stand out
- Title blends into nearby listings
- Value isn't clear at a glance

No click means no second chance. This is part of the [conversion-visibility feedback loop](/blog/airbnb-seo-2026).

### What brings views back

- A cover image that communicates the stay instantly
- A title that signals benefit, not adjectives
- Photos ordered for scanning, not storytelling

This is especially important for [complex properties](/blog/high-end-large-properties).

Views increase when guests pause instead of scroll.

If you're not sure what guests are skipping past, tools like [AirbnbOptimizer](https://airbnboptimizer.com?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=not-getting-views) can help identify where attention drops.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do views matter more than bookings?**
They're upstream. Without views, bookings can't happen.

**Should I change my cover photo often?**
Only when it improves clarity or contrast.

**Does price affect views?**
Indirectly, through clicks.

**Are insights accurate?**
They're directional, not diagnostic.
