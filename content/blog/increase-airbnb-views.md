Views don't disappear randomly.

They fade when guests scroll past.

I've covered [why this happens](/blog/not-getting-views) in detail.

### The three things that actually increase views

**1. A cover photo that explains the stay**
Not the nicest photo. The clearest one. Guests should understand the experience instantly.

**2. A title that signals benefit, not adjectives**
"Hot Tub Cabin Near Trails" outperforms "Cozy Mountain Retreat" every time. Common [title mistakes](/blog/airbnb-description-mistakes) hurt here.

**3. Early photo contrast**
Your first five photos should show five different reasons to stay. This becomes critical for [larger properties](/blog/high-end-large-properties).

When guests pause instead of scroll, impressions rise.
