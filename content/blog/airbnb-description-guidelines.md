## Airbnb's Advice Is Solid—It's Just Incomplete

Airbnb's guidance on listing descriptions hasn't changed much over the years. And honestly, that's a good thing.

They're clear about the goal:
- help guests picture the stay
- set expectations early
- avoid disappointment

That's exactly what descriptions are supposed to do.

Where hosts tend to struggle isn't *following* the advice.
It's figuring out **what deserves attention** inside it.

## "Keep It Brief" Doesn't Mean "Say Less"

Airbnb encourages hosts to keep descriptions brief because guests scan.

That doesn't mean cutting useful information.

It means cutting:
- repeated amenity lists
- generic praise ("beautiful," "cozy," "perfect")
- anything already obvious from photos

The space you save should go somewhere specific:
- layout clarity
- who the place works best for
- things guests usually ask after booking

If guests message you the same questions repeatedly, that's a signal the description isn't brief *in the right places*.

## "Tell the Story" Means Describe the Experience, Not the Furniture

One line from Airbnb's guidance that I think gets misunderstood is *"tell the story of your space."*

That doesn't mean writing creatively for the sake of it.

It means answering questions like:
- What does a normal morning here feel like?
- How do guests actually use the space?
- What's different about staying here versus nearby options?

"A perfect base for exploring the city" works because it sets expectations.
So does "quiet at night, lively during the day."

Both are stories. Neither is flowery.

## Focus on What Guests Compare—Not Everything You Offer

Airbnb suggests highlighting special features. The trap is trying to highlight *all* of them.

Guests don't compare:
- every appliance
- every decor choice

They compare:
- location tradeoffs
- layout convenience
- noise, stairs, parking
- privacy vs shared spaces

If something regularly influences whether a guest chooses *you* or the listing next door, it belongs in the description.

If it doesn't affect that decision, it probably belongs somewhere else—or nowhere at all.

## "Be Realistic" Is a Conversion Strategy

This is the part Airbnb gets exactly right.

Overselling doesn't just lead to bad reviews.
It leads to hesitant bookings.

When guests can clearly see:
- limitations
- quirks
- tradeoffs

…the *right* guests move forward faster.

The wrong guests quietly self-select out.

That's a win on both sides.

## Structure Beats Length Every Time

Airbnb encourages filling out all description sections for a reason.

Not to add more words—but to:
- separate overview from details
- keep things scannable
- reduce cognitive load

When everything lives in one block of text, guests miss things.

When each section does one job, clarity improves—even if the total word count stays the same.

This is also where many listings quietly break down.

If you're not sure *where* clarity is failing—especially in listings with more moving parts—tools like [AirbnbOptimizer](https://airbnboptimizer.com?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=airbnb-guidelines) can help surface gaps between what you think you're explaining and what guests are actually seeing.

## A Practical Way to Read Airbnb's Rules

Here's how I'd summarize Airbnb's advice after years of watching what works:

- Write for scanning, not reading
- Explain how the space works, not just what's in it
- Be honest early, not apologetic later
- Use structure to reduce questions
- Let photos attract—let words clarify

Airbnb's guidelines aren't about creativity.
They're about confidence.

## Final Thought

Airbnb tells you to help guests picture themselves in your space.

The easiest way to do that isn't better adjectives.
It's better decisions about what deserves explanation.

When guests understand what they're booking, everything downstream gets easier—for them and for you.
