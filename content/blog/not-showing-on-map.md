Map visibility is a trust signal.

When it's missing, guests feel it.

### Why listings disappear from maps

Most often:

- Address details are incomplete
- Capacity or layout feels uncertain
- The listing triggers caution signals

Airbnb protects guests by limiting precision.

### What restores map confidence

- Clear address and access details
- Strong guest reviews for accuracy
- Consistent signals across photos and text

Once guests engage confidently, map precision improves. Building that confidence usually requires [clarity improvements](/blog/views-to-bookings).
