Seasonal slowdowns aren't always demand problems.

They're explanation problems.

### Why off-season bookings stall

The listing still speaks to summer guests in winter. Or vacationers during business travel season.

Guests don't see themselves.

### How year-round bookings happen

- Adjust emphasis, not the whole listing
- Highlight off-season advantages
- Reframe who the stay is for now

The place doesn't change much. The story does. More on [adapting your description](/blog/airbnb-description-writing).
