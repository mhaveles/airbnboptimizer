    answer: "Lack of clarity about who the listing is for and what the stay actually feels like."
  - question: "How do I know if my Airbnb description is hurting bookings?"
    answer: "If guests frequently ask questions already answered in your listing, or reviews mention surprises, clarity is likely the issue."
  - question: "Should I rewrite my Airbnb description if bookings are slow?"

Most Airbnb descriptions don't *fail*.
They just… underperform.

The calendar isn't empty.
But it's not full either.
And when bookings do come in, they're often the wrong fit.

I've found that when hosts say "the photos are great and the reviews are solid," the issue usually lives in the description — not because it's bad, but because it's unclear.

Here are the mistakes I see most often.

## Mistake #1: Writing for everyone
When a description tries to appeal to *all* guests, it usually convinces none.

Phrases like "perfect for families, couples, groups, and business travelers" sound inclusive, but they force the guest to do the work of imagining themselves there.

**Fix it:**
Pick the *primary* guest type and write for them first. Others will self-select if it still fits.

## Mistake #2: Describing features, not outcomes
"Three bedrooms, two baths, open kitchen" is accurate — and forgettable.

Guests don't book square footage. They book confidence:
- Will this work for our group?
- Will we be comfortable?
- Will this be easier than the alternatives?

**Fix it:**
Explain *why* the layout matters.
Who sleeps where.
Who gets privacy.
Where people gather.

## Mistake #3: Burying important details
I often see crucial information hidden halfway down the description:
- Stairs
- Shared spaces
- Parking quirks
- Bedroom layouts

Guests who skim miss it. Guests who book anyway feel surprised.

**Fix it:**
Surface anything that affects decision-making early.
Clarity beats charm every time.

## Mistake #4: Letting photos do all the work
Photos show *what* a place looks like.
Descriptions explain *how it works*.

This gap shows up most with:
- Large homes
- Multi-level layouts
- Group or event-friendly properties

**Fix it:**
Use the description to guide the guest through the space the way you would verbally.

## Mistake #5: Optimizing for words, not behavior
Some descriptions are technically fine — but they don't answer the questions guests are actually asking.

When that happens, guests hesitate.
They open another tab.
They compare.

**Fix it:**
Read your description as if you're deciding between three similar listings.
Does yours make the decision easier?

### Where a tool can help
If you're not sure where clarity is breaking down, tools like [AirbnbOptimizer](https://airbnboptimizer.com?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=description-mistakes) can surface gaps — especially useful when a listing has more moving parts than a standard home.

Not to rewrite everything.
Just to show you where guests are likely getting stuck.

Because useful descriptions attract better-fit bookings.
And better-fit bookings usually mean smoother stays and better reviews.
